## Helicity-in-defocustracking

**This project is used to calculate helicity, vorticity and acoustic streaming. Also, this project can give a visualization of helicity, vorticity and acoustic streaming (in axial and azimuthal directions).**


**The main program is written in Jupyter Nootbook, named GDPT_helicity.ipynb. Other modules like GDPT_import_data.py, GDPT_handling_vibration.py, helicity2vorticity.py and GDPT_plot.py, are respectively used to realized different functions such as import data, handling data, calculate data and visual data.**


**Here are two examples of W-1 and w-15 (w1.zip and w15.zip, which need to be unpacked before being imported)**
